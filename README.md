## Why?

The original FFXIV launcher is slow, tedious, kinda ugly and cannot save your password. This project aims to fix that and add some QoL features to the game that were not there before, such as:

* Auto-login
* Fast patching
* Launching tools like ACT when starting the game
* Discord Rich Presence
* Fast in-game market board price checks
* Integrity check for game files
* Chat filtering
* Chat bridge to Discord
* Discord notifications for duties, retainer sales, etc.

Check the settings page and use the /xlhelp command in-game to see available commands.

## How to install

[Download the latest "Setup.exe" from the releases](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher/releases/latest) page and run it. XIVLauncher will start and will be installed to your start menu.

As with all of my stuff, this is technically not in line with Square Enix TOS - I've tried to make it as undetectable as possible and no one, as far as I know, has gotten into trouble for using this - but it always could be a possibility.
